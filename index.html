                This project is based upon novel <b>LIH (Location Impalpability Heuristics) framework</b>.
                This project enables the end user/consumer to perform the required action (specifically commute
                to the task location) without sharing there actual location, and which helps to keep the end user's
                location based details private to them only.
                This project is cleaved into two parts, one is related to design and implementation of <b>LIH framework</b>,
                and another part is to design and implement <b>SACPR model/framework</b>.

        This algorithm is mainly designed to deduce the probability distribution table among the multiple
        location.
        This framework employs building of directional graph based on location nodes and connection between
        them.
        Then after performing the mathematical computations, we try to gather probabilities for selecting
        obfuscated
        location
        among the available location nodes. The core aim of this module is to return the probability
        distribution
        table
        which can be utilised
        for further computations. Since extensive calculations are involved, this algorithm is initially
        designed in
        MATLAB, but it can be
        inherited to frameworks based on python as well.

        This part of project is implement the employs the LIH framework, to implement the use case for critical
        patients
        requiring CPR. It allows
        the patient to ask for help and available volunteers will be notified and depending upon there response
        of
        acceptance or rejection, LIH algorithm
        helps to computes the obfuscated location of the volunteers. Based on obfuscated location, all the
        further
        computations such as calculating
        the distance from the serving location and deducing the volunteer who will finally serve the patient,
        navigation
        path to the patients locations, etc.
        It is typically react native based android application, where Python Flask is employed for backend
        computations
        and MongoDB is utilised
        for database based operations.
